# DOI Bookmarklet

## About

The DOI Bookmarklet provides access to access-restricted documents by redirecting through a ProQuest EZproxy as used by many university libraries.

## Installation

The DOI Bookmarklet is easily installable via the [GitHub Project Page](http://clinteger.github.com/doi-bookmarklet).

## How it works

The bookmarklet searches the currently selected text for a DOI (beginning with doi: or hdl:) and routes the subsequent request to http://dx.doi.org through the specified proxy.
